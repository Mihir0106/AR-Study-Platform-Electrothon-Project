# AR-Study-Platform-Electrothon-Project
We working on  project where a host (say a teacher) in their 3D space uses the offered AR features, such as writing, editing, and 3D drawing. The participants (say students) can see the host's 3D space and any activity carried out in it and can, according to him, change the view. This will enable the host to share the real-time data and content with the participants.
